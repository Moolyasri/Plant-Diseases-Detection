# Plant-Diseases-Detection

This project utilizes deep learning techniques to build a model for detecting plant diseases from leaf images. Using TensorFlow and Keras, I trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) with EfficientNetB0 as the backbone, leveraging transfer learning with pre-trained weights from ImageNet.

 The model was trained on a dataset of various plant diseases and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, and classification reports. The model was fine-tuned to improve performance. The front-end is developed using HTML and CSS for a user-friendly interface, while the back-end is powered by Flask and MongoDB for efficient handling of data. 

The system allows users to upload leaf images for disease classification, providing real-time predictions. The trained model and the complete application are deployed, and the model is available for download. This project serves as an effective tool for automated plant disease diagnosis, offering a convenient solution for farmers and agricultural enthusiasts.
